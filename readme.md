This is a fork of [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) that adds firmware for the [ellipsis split](git@github.com:csun/ellipsis_split_files.git). If someone wants to merge this back in to the main QMK repo, it would be greatly appreciated.

PCB and plate files can be found [here](https://github.com/csun/ellipsis_split_files)
